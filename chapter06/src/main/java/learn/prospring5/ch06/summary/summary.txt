This chapter showed you how to use Spring to simplify JDBC programming. You learned how to connect to a
database and perform selects, updates, deletes, and inserts, as well as call database stored functions. Using
the core Spring JDBC class, JdbcTemplate, was discussed in detail. We covered other Spring classes that are
built on top of JdbcTemplate and that help you model various JDBC operations. We also showed how to
use the new lambda expressions from Java 8 where appropriate. In addition, Spring Boot JDBC was covered
because whatever helps you focus more on the implementation of the business logic of an application and
less on the configurations is a great tool to know. In the next couple of chapters, we discuss how to use
Spring with popular ORM technologies when developing data access logic.
