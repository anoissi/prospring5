In this chapter, we covered the basic concepts of JPA and how to configure JPA’s EntityManagerFactory in
Spring by using Hibernate as the persistence service provider. Then we discussed using JPA to perform basic
database operations. Advanced topics included native queries and the strongly typed JPA Criteria API.
Additionally, we demonstrated how Spring Data JPA’s Repository abstraction can help simplify JPA
application development, as well as how to use its entity listener to keep track of basic auditing information
for entity classes. For full versioning of entity classes, using Hibernate Envers to fulfill the requirement was
also covered.
Spring Boot for JPA applications was also covered, as it simplifies configuration a lot and keeps the focus
on developing the required functionality.
In the next chapter, we discuss transaction management in Spring.
