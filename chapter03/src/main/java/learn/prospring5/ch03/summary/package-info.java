In this chapter, we covered a lot of ground with both Spring Core and IoC in general. We showed you
        examples of the types of IoC and presented the pros and cons of using each mechanism in your applications.
        We looked at which IoC mechanisms Spring provides and when (and when not) to use each within your
        applications. While exploring IoC, we introduced the Spring BeanFactory, which is the core component
        for Spring’s IoC capabilities, and then ApplicationContext, which extends BeanFactory and provides
        additional functionalities. For ApplicationContext, we focused on GenericXmlApplicationContext,
        which allows external configuration of Spring by using XML. Another method to declare DI requirements
        for ApplicationContext, that is, using Java annotations, was also discussed. Some examples with
        AnnotationConfigApplicationContext and Java configuration were also included, just to slowly introduce
        this way of configuring beans.
        This chapter also introduced you to the basics of Spring’s IoC feature set including setter
        injection, constructor injection, Method Injection, autowiring, and bean inheritance. In the
        discussion of configuration, we demonstrated how you can configure your bean properties with a
        wide variety of values, including other beans, using both XML and annotation type configurations and
        GenericXmlApplicationContext.
        This chapter only scratched the surface of Spring and Spring’s IoC container. In the next chapter,
        you’ll look at some IoC-related features specific to Spring, and you’ll take a more detailed look at other
        functionality available in Spring Core
