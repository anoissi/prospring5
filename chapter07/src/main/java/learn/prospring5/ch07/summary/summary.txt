In this chapter, we discussed the basic concepts of Hibernate and how to configure it within a Spring
application. Then we covered common techniques for defining ORM mappings, and we covered
associations and how to use the HibernateTemplate class to perform various database operations.

 With
regard to Hibernate, we covered only a small piece of its functionality and features. For those interested
in using Hibernate with Spring, we highly recommend you study Hibernateâ€™s standard documentation.


Also, numerous books discuss Hibernate in detail. We recommend Beginning Hibernate: For Hibernate 5
by Joseph Ottinger, Jeff Linwood, and Dave Minter (Apress, 2016), 3 as well as Pro JPA 2 by Mike Keith and
Merrick Schincariol (Apress, 2013).

4 In the next chapter, you will take a look at JPA and how to use it when
using Spring. Hibernate provides excellent support for JPA, and we will continue to use Hibernate as the
persistence provider for the examples in the next chapter. For query and update operations, JPA act likes
Hibernate. In the next chapter, we discuss advanced topics including native and criteria query and how we
can use Hibernate as well as its JPA support.
